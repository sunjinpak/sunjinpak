                            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study investigates the relationship between technology-assisted supplemental work (TASW) fairness and resource investment strategies in the workplace, namely personal initiative and work withdrawal behaviors, with energy as a mediating factor and conscientiousness and neuroticism as moderators. A sample of 728 U.S. employees was collected to test the proposed model using mediation and moderated-mediation analyses. The study finds support for the mediation hypotheses, indicating that when employees perceive TASW as fair (unfair), they report higher (lower) energy levels and are thus likely to engage in personal initiative (work withdrawal) behaviors. Additionally, conscientiousness strengthens the positive relationship between TASW-fairness and personal initiative, while the negative relationship between TASW-fairness and work withdrawal appears consistent across neuroticism levels. This study introduces the concept of technology-assisted supplemental work (TASW) within a fairness framework and relates it to resource investment strategies in the workplace, providing novel insights into the role of fairness perceptions and individual differences in shaping employee behaviors.</p>

                                working hours, perceived health, and wages in South Korea, with a focus on gender
                                disparities. The researchers hypothesize a U-inverted relationship between paid working
                                hours and health, suggesting that health improves with longer hours up to a certain
                                point and then declines. They further hypothesize a reciprocal positive relationship
                                between health and wages, and that women experience negative health impacts at lower
                                work-hour thresholds than men. Using 13 years of data from the Korean Labor and Income
                                Panel Study (KLIPS), the study found an inverted U-curve relationship between working
                                hours and perceived health. The health inflection points were observed at 41.36 hours
                                for men and 28.95 hours for women, indicating that women experience negative health
                                effects sooner than men, likely due to unpaid domestic work. The research also
                                identified a positive bidirectional link between health and wages. This study provides
                                causal evidence on how paid working hours affect health and wages, emphasizing the need
                                for gender-specific considerations in policy and workplace practices.</p>

                                digital environments by proposing human resource (HR) management strategies derived from
                                a systematic review of the literature. It seeks to clarify the concept of cyber
                                incivility, identify its antecedents and outcomes, and provide practical recommendations
                                for HR practices to mitigate its effects. The included studies (n = 31) examined diverse
                                professional contexts, with sample sizes ranging from 69 to 830 participants. Cyber
                                incivility is shaped by individual factors (e.g., personality traits, demographic
                                characteristics), situational factors (e.g., workload, stress), and technology-driven
                                factors (e.g., misinterpretation in digital communication). Its negative impacts include
                                reduced job satisfaction, heightened stress, burnout, and increased turnover intentions.
                                Evidence-based HR recommendations include developing digital communication guidelines,
                                implementing resilience-building programs, and offering training on digital etiquette
                                and conflict resolution. This study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding
                                cyber incivility in digital work environments and offers evidence-based HR interventions
                                to foster respectful communication and improve employee well-being.</p>

                            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study explores the mediating role of trust in management
                                in the link between High-Performance Work Systems (HPWS) and organizational performance.
                                It specifically investigates how shared perceptions of HPWS between employees and
                                management can contribute to a competitive advantage. The results highlight the
                                importance of consensus among employees regarding HR practices. The findings indicate
                                that while employee-management congruence in HPWS perceptions did not directly moderate
                                the HPWS-firm performance relationship, it significantly influenced the indirect effect
                                through trust in management. The positive impact of HPWS on performance via trust was
                                stronger when there was high congruence between employee and management perceptions.
                                This research extends the social exchange perspective on the HPWS-performance
                                relationship by incorporating trust in management as a critical mediator and
                                employee-management congruence in HPWS perceptions as a moderator.</p>

                                work outcomes, specifically work withdrawal and turnover intention. The authors draw on
                                self-determination theory and conservation of resources theory to examine the mediating
                                roles of basic need satisfaction and burnout in this relationship. Furthermore, the
                                study investigates conscientiousness and neuroticism as boundary conditions that

                                the United States, the results support the hypotheses that cyber incivility is

                            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Work-family policies aim to support individuals in the
                                workforce, but often lead to reduced rewards for those who utilize them. Drawing on the
                                ideal worker norm framework and signaling theory, this study hypothesized that the
                                duration of parental leave would result in lower wage growth, independently of simply
                                having children. Using discontinuous growth models, the study found that both men and
                                women experienced lower hourly wage growth when taking longer parental leave.
                                Furthermore, there were more significant penalties associated with taking paid parental
                                leave compared to unpaid parental leave. The findings suggest that while paid parental
                                leave is mostly accessible to skilled, professional employees, its use incurs a
                                noticeable early-career wage penalty. In contrast, the use of unpaid leave did not show
                                the same penalty. The study also indicated that although both genders are penalized for
                                taking parental leave, longer leaves taken by women contribute to an increased gender
                                pay gap.</p>

                                research on the relationship between working hours and the work-family interface.
                                Utilizing the work-home resources model, the study integrates work-family enrichment and
                                conflict theory, with a focus on the positive and negative mediational processes of
                                human energy. Working hours are conceptualized as having the potential to simultaneously
                                increase vigor and exhaustion, which, in turn, can lead to increased work-family
                                enrichment and work-family conflict, respectively. The model suggests, and a
                                meta-analytic investigation (N = 459,846) supports, that the two dimensions of human
                                energy—vigor and exhaustion—mediate the relationship between working hours and
                                work-to-family enrichment and conflict. These findings contribute to the literature by
                                integrating positive and negative energy mechanisms in the relationship between working

                                critical job stressor, leading to negative health outcomes for workers and potentially
                                increased healthcare costs for employers. While sleep quality is a significant health
                                indicator, its relationship with perceived job insecurity has been understudied. Using
                                job stress concepts and a perseverative cognition model, the researchers examined the
                                association between perceived job insecurity and subjective sleep quality, with negative
                                work spillover considered as a mediator. They also explored gender as a potential
                                moderator. The study comprised two parts: Study 1 utilized a nationally representative
                                sample of 1,031 working adults, and Study 2 involved a sample of 152 working adults who
                                participated in three biweekly surveys. Key Findings: Negative work spillover was found
                                to mediate the relationship between perceived job insecurity and subjective sleep
                                quality in both studies. Contrary to their initial prediction, no gender moderation was
                                found in either study, meaning the relationship between job insecurity and subjective
                                sleep quality, as mediated by negative work spillover, did not significantly differ
                                between men and women.</p>

                                satisfaction. The researchers hypothesized that a father's use of paternity leave would
                                increase his job and life satisfaction, and this positive effect would 'cross over' to
                                his spouse's family relationship satisfaction, which is highly correlated with marital
                                satisfaction. The findings indicate robust evidence of a long-term effect, showing that
                                even a few days of paternity leave can have a measurable impact on the couple. The study
                                suggests that supporting fathers through paternity leave can positively influence family

                                followed the same individuals over four years and analyzed their data using a
                                cross-lagged structural equation model. The findings indicate that, after controlling
                                for net income, an increase in a mother's share of family income is associated with an
                                increased level of depressive symptoms, while the same increase for fathers is related
                                to a decreased level of depressive symptoms. When examining a subsample of stay-at-home
                                parents, the study found that a change to stay-at-home parent status, after previously
                                contributing to family income, is linked to a higher level of depressive symptoms for
                                fathers, but not for mothers.</p>
