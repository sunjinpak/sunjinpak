---

## Evaluation Criteria

Jurors evaluate your oral presentation and written summary based on these criteria:

1. **Clarity of purpose** - Is the research question clear?
2. **Appropriateness of methodology** - Are the methods suitable for the research question?
3. **Interpretation of results** - Are the findings interpreted correctly?
4. **Value of the research** - Does this research contribute something meaningful?
5. **Ability to articulate the research** - Can you explain your work clearly?
6. **Organization of material** - Is the presentation well-structured?
7. **Ability to address questions** - Can you respond thoughtfully to Q&A?

## Slide-by-Slide Guide

### 1. Title Slide (1 slide)

**Include:**
- Research title
- Author names
- Affiliation (California State University, Bakersfield)
- Date
- Competition/Conference name (if applicable)

**Example:**
```
The Impact of Leader Workaholism on
Working Students' Emotional Exhaustion

Jesus Garcia & Eric Martinez
California State University, Bakersfield

CSUB Student Research Competition
March 6, 2026
```

---

### 2. Introduction (3-4 slides)

#### Slide: Research Problem / Why This Matters
- What is the issue?
- Why should the audience care?
- Use statistics or real-world examples

#### Slide: Key Concepts
- Define main variables
- Keep definitions simple and clear

#### Slide: Literature Review Summary
- What do we already know?
- What is missing? (Research gap)
- 2-3 key findings from prior research

#### Slide: Research Model & Hypotheses
- Show your conceptual model (diagram)
- List your hypotheses clearly

**Example Model Diagram:**
```
┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
│ Leader          │ H1   │ After-hours │ H2   │ Emotional    │
│ Workaholism     │ ───► │ ICT Use     │ ───► │ Exhaustion   │
└─────────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └──────────────┘
```

### 3. Method (2-3 slides)

#### Slide: Participants
- Sample size (N = ?)
- Demographics (age, gender, ethnicity)
- How they were recruited

#### Slide: Measures
- List each variable and how it was measured
- Include reliability (Cronbach's alpha)
- Keep it brief - no need for full item wording

**Example:**

| Variable | Measure | Items | α |
|----------|---------|-------|-----|
| Leader Workaholism | MWS (Clark et al., 2020) | 4 | .93 |
| ICT Use | Single item | 1 | - |
| Emotional Exhaustion | MBI (Maslach & Jackson, 1981) | 5 | .94 |

#### Slide: Analysis (optional)
- Briefly mention your analysis approach
- "We used regression analysis to test our hypotheses"

---

### 4. Results (3-4 slides)

#### Slide: Descriptive Statistics
- Show Table 1 (correlation table)
- Highlight key correlations

#### Slide: Hypothesis 1 Results
- State the hypothesis
- Show the result (supported or not supported)
- Include key statistics (B, SE, p)

**Example:**
```
Hypothesis 1: Leader workaholism is positively
related to after-hours ICT use.

✓ Supported (B = 0.36, p = .004)
```

#### Slide: Hypothesis 2 Results
- Same format as H1

#### Slide: Results Summary (optional)
- Visual summary of all hypothesis tests
- Use checkmarks (✓) for supported, X for not supported

---

### 5. Discussion (2-3 slides)

#### Slide: Key Takeaways
- What do the results mean?
- 2-3 main conclusions

#### Slide: Practical Implications
- How can organizations/individuals use these findings?
- Real-world applications

#### Slide: Limitations & Future Research
- Be honest about limitations
- Suggest directions for future studies

---

### 6. Final Slide

**Options:**
- "Thank You" with contact information
- "Questions?" slide
- Summary of key points

---

## Design Tips

### Do's
- Use large fonts (minimum 24pt for body text, 32pt+ for titles)
- Use bullet points, not paragraphs
- One main idea per slide
- Use visuals (charts, diagrams, images)
- Use consistent colors and fonts
- Leave white space

### Don'ts
- Don't put too much text on one slide
- Don't read directly from slides
- Don't use distracting animations
- Don't use low-quality images
- Don't use more than 3 colors

### Font Recommendations
- Titles: 36-44pt, Bold
- Body text: 24-28pt
- Fonts: Arial, Calibri, or Helvetica (clean and readable)

---

## Presenting Tips

### Before the Presentation
- Practice multiple times
- Time yourself
- Practice with your co-presenter
- Prepare for common questions

### During the Presentation
- Make eye contact with the audience
- Speak clearly and slowly
- Don't read from slides - use them as prompts
- Both team members should present roughly equal portions

### Handling Q&A
- Listen carefully to the question
- It's okay to say "That's a great question, we didn't examine that in this study"
- Be honest if you don't know the answer
- Bring a notebook and take notes during feedback - this shows you're engaged and taking their comments seriously
- Leave an impression that you plan to continue this research beyond the competition
