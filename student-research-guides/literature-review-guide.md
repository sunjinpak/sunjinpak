# Literature Review Guide

This guide explains how to conduct a literature review for your research paper.

---

## 1. What is a Literature Review?

A literature review summarizes and synthesizes existing research on your topic. It serves to:

- Establish the theoretical foundation for your study
- Identify gaps in existing research
- Justify why your research is needed
- Support your hypotheses with prior findings

---

## 2. Finding Academic Sources

### Step 1: Search on Google Scholar

1. Go to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)
2. Enter keywords related to your research topic
3. Use quotation marks for exact phrases (e.g., "work-life balance")
4. Use AND/OR to combine terms (e.g., leadership AND burnout)

**Search Tips:**
- Start broad, then narrow down
- Look at highly cited papers first
- Check the references of relevant papers to find more sources
- Use "Cited by" to find newer papers that cite a classic study

### Step 2: Download PDFs from CSUB Library

Google Scholar shows article information, but many PDFs require library access.

1. Go to [CSUB Library Website](https://www.csub.edu/library)
2. Search for the **paper title** in the search box
3. Log in with your CSUB credentials if prompted
4. Download the PDF

## 3. Organizing Your Sources

### Create a Reference List

Keep track of all sources you find:

| Author(s) | Year | Title | Journal | Key Findings |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|--------------|
| Smith et al. | 2020 | Title here | JAP | Finding 1, Finding 2 |

### Use Reference Management Tools (Optional)

## 4. Reading Academic Papers

### What to Focus On

1. **Abstract** - Quick overview of the study
2. **Introduction** - Why the research matters, hypotheses
3. **Discussion** - What the findings mean
4. **Results** - Key statistics (if needed)

### Taking Notes

For each paper, note:
- Main argument/theory
- Key findings
- How it relates to YOUR research
- Useful quotes (with page numbers)

---

## 5. Writing the Literature Review

### Structure

1. **Opening** - Introduce the broad topic
2. **Theoretical Background** - Explain key concepts and theories
3. **Review of Prior Research** - Summarize relevant studies
4. **Research Gap** - What hasn't been studied yet?
5. **Hypotheses** - Your predictions based on the literature

### Writing Tips

- **Synthesize, don't summarize** - Group studies by theme, not one-by-one
- **Be critical** - Note limitations of prior research
- **Build an argument** - Each paragraph should lead to the next
- **Connect to your study** - Explain how each source relates to your research

### Example Flow

```
Paragraph 1: Define the main concept (e.g., workaholism)
Paragraph 2: Discuss consequences of workaholism (cite 3-4 studies)
Paragraph 3: Introduce the mediating variable (e.g., work-life conflict)
Paragraph 4: Explain why this relationship exists (theory)
Paragraph 5: Identify the gap and state your hypothesis
```

## 6. How Many Sources?

For a research paper:
- **Minimum**: 15-20 sources
- **Ideal**: 25-30 sources
- Focus on **peer-reviewed journal articles**
- Prioritize **recent publications** (last 10 years)
- Include **seminal/classic papers** when relevant

---

## 7. Avoiding Plagiarism

- Always paraphrase in your own words
- Use direct quotes sparingly (and cite with page numbers)
- Cite every idea that isn't your own
- When in doubt, cite it
