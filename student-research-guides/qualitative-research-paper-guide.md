# Qualitative Research Paper Guide

This guide explains how to write a qualitative research paper in APA 7th Edition format.

---

## Sample Paper

Here is an example of a published qualitative research paper you can reference:

- [Cardador, Hill, & Salles (2022) - Unpacking the Status-Leveling Burden for Women in Male-Dominated Occupations (PDF)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d8a5qTsULVkepyNcCGOQw29Kwj9GIXDV/view?usp=sharing) - *Administrative Science Quarterly*

This study used semi-structured interviews with 45 surgeons (29 female, 16 male) to examine status tensions between female surgeons and nurses. The researchers employed grounded theory methodology with iterative coding and constant comparative analysis.

## 1. Title Page

Same format as quantitative papers:
- Paper title (bold, centered)
- Author name(s)
- Institutional affiliation
- Running head

---

## 2. Abstract

- 150-250 words
- Include research question, method, key findings, and theoretical contribution
- Keywords

---

## 3. Introduction

### Components
1. **Opening** - Introduce the research phenomenon
2. **Research Problem** - What is puzzling or unexplored?
3. **Research Question** - What does this study aim to understand?
4. **Contribution Preview** - How does this study advance knowledge?

### Example Research Questions

```
How do employees make sense of contradictory organizational
messages about work-life balance?

What processes explain how newcomers develop professional
identity in ambiguous roles?

How do managers navigate competing demands from multiple
stakeholders?
```

**Note:** Qualitative research often uses "how" and "what" questions rather than hypothesis testing.

---

## 4. Theoretical Background

Unlike quantitative papers, qualitative studies may:
- Present theory to **sensitize** rather than predict
- Build theory inductively from data
- Use existing frameworks loosely to guide inquiry

### Components
1. **Relevant Literature** - What do we know about this topic?
2. **Theoretical Lens** - What concepts help frame the inquiry?
3. **Gap or Puzzle** - What remains unexplained?

---

## 5. Method Section

The method section in qualitative research must establish **transparency** and **trustworthiness**.

### 5.1 Research Design

State your methodological approach:
- Grounded theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Corbin & Strauss, 2015)
- Case study (Yin, 2018)
- Ethnography
- Phenomenology
- Thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006)

**Example:**
```
We employed a grounded theory approach (Corbin & Strauss, 2015)
to develop theory inductively from the data. This approach was
appropriate given the limited prior research on [topic] and our
aim to build rather than test theory.
```

### 5.2 Research Context

Describe the setting:
- Organization(s) or field site
- Why this context is appropriate
- Access and entry

**Example:**
```
We conducted this study in the context of [industry/setting]
in the [location]. Specifically, we focused on [target population]
who [relevant characteristic]. This setting was appropriate
because [reason why this context fits the research question].
```

### 5.3 Participants and Sampling

Describe:
- Sample size and composition
- Sampling strategy (purposive → theoretical)
- Selection criteria
- How saturation was reached

**Example:**
```
We interviewed [N] participants ([breakdown by key characteristics])
from [setting/organizations]. We used purposive sampling initially,
selecting participants who [selection criteria]. As analysis
progressed, we employed theoretical sampling (Glaser & Strauss,
1967), seeking participants who could help us explore emerging
concepts. Data collection continued until we reached theoretical
saturation, defined as the point at which additional interviews
yielded no new conceptual insights.
```

### 5.4 Data Collection

Describe:
- Data sources (interviews, observations, documents, etc.)
- Interview protocol (semi-structured, duration)
- Recording and transcription

**Example:**
```
We conducted semi-structured interviews lasting 45-90 minutes.
Interviews were conducted via [phone/video/in-person] and
were audio-recorded with participant consent. All interviews
were transcribed verbatim, yielding [X] pages of single-spaced
text. Our interview protocol included questions about [topic areas].
Sample questions included: "Describe a typical day at work"
and "Tell me about [specific aspect of phenomenon]."
```

### 5.5 Data Analysis

Describe your coding process:
1. **Initial/Open Coding** - Line-by-line analysis
2. **Focused/Axial Coding** - Grouping into categories
3. **Theoretical Coding** - Identifying relationships

Include:
- Software used (NVivo, Atlas.ti, etc.)
- Multiple coders and reliability
- Use of memos
- Constant comparative analysis

**Example:**
```
Data analysis followed the iterative procedures recommended
for grounded theory (Corbin & Strauss, 2015). First, we
engaged in open coding, reading transcripts line-by-line
and assigning initial codes that stayed close to the data.
This yielded over 200 initial codes. Second, we used focused
coding to consolidate related codes into broader categories.
Through constant comparative analysis, we moved iteratively
between data and emerging concepts. We wrote extensive
analytic memos throughout to document our reasoning and
emerging interpretations. Two members of the research team
independently coded a subset of transcripts to ensure
consistency in code application, discussing discrepancies
until reaching consensus. Analysis was conducted using
NVivo 12 software.
```

## 6. Findings Section

### Presenting Qualitative Findings

Unlike quantitative "Results," qualitative papers present "Findings" that:
- Tell a coherent story
- Use participant quotes as evidence
- Show the data structure

### Data Structure Table

Many top-journal qualitative papers include a visual representation of how data was analyzed:

```
1st-Order Concepts        →    2nd-Order Themes    →    Aggregate Dimensions
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"[Raw quote from data]"        [Theme name]            [Broader category]
"[Another raw quote]"
"[Related quote]"

"[Different raw quote]"        [Another theme]         [Another category]
"[Supporting quote]"
```

### Using Quotations

- Use direct quotes to support each theme
- Introduce quotes with context
- Explain what the quote demonstrates

**Example:**
```
Participants described [pattern/behavior]. As one participant
explained:

    [Direct quote from participant that illustrates the theme.
    The quote should be specific and vivid, showing the
    participant's perspective in their own words.]
    (Participant [ID])

This quotation illustrates [what this quote demonstrates and
how it supports the theme being discussed].
```

### Organizing Findings

Common approaches:
1. **Thematic** - Organize by major themes/categories
2. **Process** - Show stages or phases
3. **Chronological** - Follow a timeline
4. **Case-by-case** - Present multiple cases then compare

---

## 7. Discussion Section

### Components

1. **Summary of Key Findings** - What did you discover?
2. **Theoretical Contributions** - How does this advance theory?
3. **Practical Implications** - What can practitioners learn?
4. **Limitations** - Acknowledge boundaries
5. **Future Research** - What questions remain?

### Theoretical Contribution

Qualitative papers should articulate clear contributions:
- New concepts or constructs
- Process models
- Boundary conditions
- Integration of disparate literatures

**Example:**
```
Our study makes three theoretical contributions. First, we
introduce the concept of "[new concept name]" to describe
[what the concept captures]. This concept extends prior
research on [related literature] by [how it advances theory].
Second, we develop a process model showing how [phenomenon]
unfolds over time. Third, we identify boundary conditions
under which these dynamics are more or less pronounced.
```

- Double-spaced throughout
- 1-inch margins on all sides
- Page numbers in top right corner
- Running head on title page

### In-Text Citations

**One author:**
```
According to Pratt (2009), qualitative research...
Qualitative research requires transparency (Pratt, 2009).
```

**Two authors:**
```
Bansal and Corley (2011) argued that...
(Bansal & Corley, 2011)
```

**Three or more authors:**

One participant noted, "I feel like I have to work twice as
hard to be taken seriously" (Participant 12).
```

**Block quotes (40 words or more):**

Indent the entire quote 0.5 inches from the left margin. Do not use quotation marks.

```
One participant described their experience:

    [Extended quote that captures the participant's perspective
    in detail. Block quotes should be used sparingly for
    particularly rich or important passages that would lose
    meaning if paraphrased.] (Participant 12)
```

## 11. Key Differences from Quantitative Papers

| Aspect | Quantitative | Qualitative |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Goal | Test hypotheses | Build theory |
| Questions | "Does X affect Y?" | "How does X work?" |
| Sampling | Random, representative | Purposive, theoretical |
| Sample size | Large N | Smaller, until saturation |
| Analysis | Statistical | Coding, themes |
| Results section | "Results" | "Findings" |
| Evidence | Statistics | Quotes, thick description |

---

## 12. Quality Criteria

### Lincoln & Guba's (1985) Trustworthiness Criteria

| Quantitative | Qualitative Equivalent |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Internal validity | Credibility |
| External validity | Transferability |
| Reliability | Dependability |
| Objectivity | Confirmability |

### Strategies for Trustworthiness

- **Triangulation** - Multiple data sources or methods
- **Member checking** - Verify interpretations with participants
- **Thick description** - Detailed context for transferability
- **Audit trail** - Document analytical decisions
- **Reflexivity** - Acknowledge researcher's role and biases
- **Negative case analysis** - Examine disconfirming evidence

---

## 13. Writing Tips

### Do's
- Use clear, descriptive theme names
- Let quotes speak for themselves
- Be systematic in your analysis
- Acknowledge limitations honestly
- Make practical recommendations specific

### Don'ts
- Over-interpret what participants meant
- Cherry-pick only dramatic quotes
- Make causal claims from qualitative data
- Generalize to all people/organizations
- Include identifying information

### Voice and Tone
- Academic but accessible
- Third person (avoid "I" or "we believe")
- Past tense for methods and findings
- Present tense for discussing implications

---

## 14. Common Mistakes

1. **Insufficient method detail**
   - ❌ "We coded the data"
   - ✅ Detailed description of coding stages, examples, iterations

2. **Quotes without analysis**
   - ❌ Long quotes with no interpretation
   - ✅ Explain what each quote demonstrates

3. **Overclaiming generalizability**
   - ❌ "All employees experience..." or "This always happens..."
   - ✅ "Our findings suggest that in contexts similar to..."

4. **Missing data structure**
   - Include visual representation of coding progression

5. **Weak theoretical contribution**
   - Clearly articulate what new knowledge your study offers
