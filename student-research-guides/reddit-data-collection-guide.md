# Reddit Data Collection Guide

This guide explains how to collect qualitative data from Reddit for research purposes.

---

## Overview

Reddit is a valuable source of qualitative data because users share detailed personal experiences in topic-specific communities (subreddits). This guide covers best practices for systematic data collection.

---

## Step 1: Set Up a Shared Google Sheet

Create a Google Sheet with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Post ID | Reddit post/comment ID for reference |
| Subreddit | Source subreddit |
| Date | When posted |
| Quote/Summary | Key content (paraphrase, don't copy entire posts) |
| Category/Theme | Categorize the issue |
| Context | Industry, job type, demographics if mentioned |
| Notes | Your observations |

---

## Step 2: Identify Target Subreddits

### Finding Relevant Subreddits
1. Search Reddit for your topic keywords
2. Identify subreddits where users share personal experiences
3. Prioritize active subreddits with substantial post history

### Example Subreddit Categories
- **Work/Career**: r/jobs, r/careerguidance, r/antiwork, r/AskHR
- **Health**: r/ChronicPain, r/mentalhealth, r/ADHD
- **Parenting**: r/Parenting, r/workingmoms, r/daddit
- **Industry-Specific**: r/nursing, r/Teachers, r/accounting

---

## Step 3: Search Strategy

### Using Reddit Search
Within your target subreddit, use the search bar to find relevant posts.

### Keyword Examples
Adapt these to your research topic:
- Role-related: "work", "job", "boss", "manager", "HR", "coworker"
- Policy-related: "leave", "accommodations", "remote work", "policy"
- Experience-related: "told my", "asked for", "struggled with"

### Search Tips
- Use quotes for exact phrases: "told my manager"
- Try variations: "boss" vs "supervisor" vs "manager"
- Sort by relevance or by new/top posts

---

## Step 4: Data Collection Process

### What to Look For
1. **Personal experiences** - First-hand accounts, not advice-seeking
2. **Detailed stories** - Posts with context and specifics
3. **Workplace interactions** - How situations were handled
4. **Policy mentions** - What helped or was missing
5. **Emotional content** - Challenges, frustrations, successes

### How to Record
- **Paraphrase or summarize** - Don't copy entire posts verbatim
- **Note the context** - Industry, role, company size if mentioned
- **Flag insightful posts** - Mark particularly rich data for deeper analysis
- **Record post ID** - For reference and verification

### Avoiding Duplicates
- Before adding a post, search your Google Sheet by keywords or post title
- If working in a team, divide keywords or time periods

---

## Step 5: Team Coordination (If Applicable)

### Dividing Work
| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| By keyword | Team member A searches keywords 1-5, B searches 6-10 |
| By time period | A collects 2024 posts, B collects 2025 posts |
| By subreddit | A focuses on r/subreddit1, B focuses on r/subreddit2 |

### Communication
- Meet regularly to discuss findings and avoid overlap
- Share interesting patterns you notice
- Update the shared sheet in real-time

---

## Ethical Considerations

1. **Public Data Only** - Only use posts from public subreddits
2. **Anonymity** - Never include usernames in your final report
3. **Paraphrase** - Summarize rather than quote extensively to protect privacy
4. **No Direct Contact** - Do not message Reddit users
5. **Research Purpose** - Data is for academic analysis only
6. **IRB Compliance** - Follow your institution's research ethics guidelines

---

## Step 6: Coding and Analysis

After data collection, analyze the data using qualitative methods.

### Coding Process
1. **Open coding** - Read through data, identify initial patterns
2. **Axial coding** - Group related codes into categories
3. **Selective coding** - Identify overarching themes

### Creating a Thematic Table
Organize your findings into a table showing:
- 1st-order concepts (raw data patterns)
- 2nd-order themes (grouped categories)
- Aggregate dimensions (broader theoretical concepts)

See [Qualitative Research Paper Guide](qualitative-research-paper-guide) for detailed guidance on analysis and presenting findings.

## Data Quality Tips

### Signs of Good Data
- Detailed personal narratives
- Specific examples and situations
- Emotional authenticity
- Relevant to research question

### Data to Skip
- Very short posts without detail
- Posts that are purely advice-seeking without experience sharing
- Duplicate or cross-posted content
- Posts that seem fabricated or trolling
